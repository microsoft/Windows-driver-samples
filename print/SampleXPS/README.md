XPS Documents Print Sample
==========================

This sample is a set of documents that were generated from a variety of sources, including those generated from the Windows Presentation Foundation in the .NET Framework, from Office 2007, and from the Microsoft XPS Document Writer (MXDW). The set of documents also includes documents that were either hand-built from scratch or hand-modified from another source. They have been included to provide you with a few documents that exercise a variety of features of the XML Paper Specification.

In addition, a few high-quality documents have been provided in the Showcase directory to highlight some of the XPS advantages in terms of screen-to-print fidelity. There are also some documents that are intended to fail by violating at least one conformance rule. These are in the ConformanceViolations directory.
