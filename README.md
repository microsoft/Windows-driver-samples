# Driver samples for Windows 11

These are the official Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK) driver code samples for Windows 11. They provide a foundation for Universal Windows driver support of all hardware form factors, from phones to desktop PCs. Use these samples with Visual Studio 2022 and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 11.

## Windows 11 driver development

Use Visual Studio 2022 and Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 11 to build, test, and deploy your drivers. With Windows 11, the driver development environment is integrated into Visual Studio. To get started, download the driver development kits and tools for Windows 11.

### Windows Driver Frameworks

The Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF) are a set of libraries that make it simple to write high-quality device drivers.

### Samples

Use the samples in this repo to guide your Windows driver development. Whether you're just getting started or porting an older driver to the newest version of Windows, code samples are valuable guides on how to write drivers.

For information about important changes that need to be made to the WDK sample drivers before releasing device drivers based on the sample code, see the following topic:

### Build your first driver

If you're writing your first driver, use these exercises to get started. Each exercise is independent of the others, so you can do them in any order.
