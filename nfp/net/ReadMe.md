Near-Field Proximity Sample Driver (UMDF Version 1)
===================================================

This sample demonstrates how to use User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF) version 1 to write a near-field proximity driver.

Typically, a near-field proximity driver would use near-field technologies such as Near Field Communication (NFC), TransferJet, or Bump. However, this sample uses a TCP/IPv6 network connection and a static configuration between two machines to simulate near-field interaction.
