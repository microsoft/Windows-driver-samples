HClient sample application
==========================

The *HClient* sample demonstrates how to write a user-mode client application that communicates with HID devices. (These are devices that conform to the HID device class specification.)

You will find this sample useful if you need to develop an application that communicates with, or extracts information from, a HID device. This sample illustrates a method for detecting a connected HID, opening that device for communication, and extracting or formatting the data into, or from, device reports.
